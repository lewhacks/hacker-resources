# What is a hackathon?

### "Hacking"? I don't like the sound of that.

A hackathon is an event where developers, makers, and designers come together, and build amazing technology in a very short amount of time, usually 12 to even 48 hours. With these projects, not only are they able to win prizes, but create something revolutionary that can help change the world. Usually occuring during the weekend, hackathons provide free swag, great food for all, and a great environment for developers.

### Wait, do I have to meet other ... people???

When you go to a hackathon, you often form teams with others, whether they are with people you know, or strangers you never met. Although this may seem daunting and scary, forming a team is an integral part of a hackathon, and through it, not only can you network with amazing people, but also learn a thing or two from them.

### But what if I'm only in high school?

Student hackathons are usually the most prevalent. One of the most prominent organization / league for hackathons is [Major League Hacking](https://mlh.io/), help sponsor hackathons big and small, providing them the resources to become an amazing event.

Whether you decide to attend a small hackathon (like [lewHacks()](http://lewhacks.tech/)) or a large hackathon (like [Pennapps](http://2017w.pennapps.com/)), always make sure to have fun, and let your creativity run wild!
